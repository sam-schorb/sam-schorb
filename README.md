# Welcome to Sam Schorb's GitHub

Hi there! I'm Sam, creator of some exciting web applications you can try here:

I'm a Full-Stack developer and creative technologist with a background in electronic music production and education. I'm the founder of IImaginary, where I focus on developing innovative tools for creators, blending my passion for art and music with cutting-edge technology.

## About Me

I thrive on technically challenging Full-Stack projects - always finding creative uses for new technological advancements. My typical stack is NextJS, Node and MongoDB - deployed using Vercel. My expertise includes integrating AI into applications; designing innovative and customisable user interfaces; PCB design and manufacturing and writing advanced algorithms for digital signal processing. I have experience implementing a wide range of APIs into applications. My machine and deep learning skills include fine-tuning base models and utilising data science techniques for problem solving.

## Skills

Here's a quick overview of my technical skill set:

- **Languages**: Typescript, JavaScript, Python, C++
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: NextJS, React, Tailwind, Express, Prettier, ESLint, Jest
- **Machine and Deep Learning**: LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic & Gemini), SciKit Learn, Pandas, Jupyter, Google Colab
- **Services**: Git, MongoDB, HuggingFace, Vercel, Heroku, Illustrator, Wordpress

## My Work

My projects often reflect my diverse interests and skills, bridging the gap between music and interactive technology:

- [**Visions**](https://visions.iimaginary.com/): An application I developed that showcases my ability to integrate AI into creative tools. 
- [**Raincloud**](https://raincloud.iimaginary.com/patch/6672d2bd539caa38942aa0e5): A web service that transforms RNBO patches from Max MSP into fully hosted websites. 
- **Typesetter**: A sophisticated tool designed to typeset a plaintext file into a novel-formatted PDF. It intelligently processes content to create a professionally styled book layout, incorporating advanced text processing algorithms and principles of professional book design.
- [**Polygon**](https://polygon.iimaginary.com/): A web-based drum sequencing machine that uses spatial computing principles to create unconventional, asymmetrical drum sequences. It allows users to place nodes representing different drum sounds on a blank canvas, dictating rhythm timing and sequence through spatial arrangement. 
- [**Droplets**](https://droplets.iimaginary.com/): A web application developed using RNBO, providing an intuitive interface similar to platforms like Spotify. It allows MaxMSP users to upload and host audio-only versions of their patches on the web, leveraging RNBO's web assembly feature for integrating synthesized sounds and random seed parameters. 
- [**Orbits**](https://iimaginary.com/orbits/): A stochastic drum machine and sequencer that operates directly in a web browser. It randomizes patterns but allows users to control macro parameters like pattern density, offering a distinct and playful experience in drum sequencing. 


## Collaboration

I'm always open to collaborating on projects that are at the intersection of music and technology. If you're interested in pushing the boundaries of what's possible in this space, I'd love to hear from you.
