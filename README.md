# Welcome to Sam Schorb's GitHub

Hi there! I'm Sam, a creative technologist and full-stack developer with a rich background in electronic music production and education. I'm the founder of Imaginary, where I focus on developing innovative tools for musicians and creators, blending my passion for music with cutting-edge technology.

## About Me

With over a decade of experience as an electronic musician, I've toured internationally, released critically acclaimed music, and cultivated a deep understanding of both the artistic and technical sides of the music industry. My journey has taken me from producing music to teaching primary school, and now to the realm of software development, where I use my self-taught programming skills to build applications and hardware that push the boundaries of music and tech.

## My Work

My projects often reflect my diverse interests and skills, bridging the gap between music and interactive technology:

- **Raincloud**: A web service that enables MaxMSP users to convert RNBO patches into playable instruments online using WebAudioAPI.
- **Droplets**: Think of it as a dynamic Spotify for generative music, where MaxMSP RNBO patches create tracks that sound different with each play.
- **Sequencer1**: Currently in development, this is a generative hardware sequencer that brings the principles of live coding into a tangible form, allowing for on-the-fly creation of rhythmic patterns.
- **LiveLoop**: A clockable Eurorack looping module for live performances, ensuring that artists can loop and record with perfect timing.

## Skills

Here's a quick overview of my technical skill set:

- **Languages**: JavaScript (React), C++, MaxMSP, Gen~, PureData
- **Hardware**: PCB Design, Eurorack Module Creation, DaisySP
- **Other**: Full Stack Development, Digital Audio Workstation Proficiency, Music Production

## Collaboration

I'm always open to collaborating on projects that are at the intersection of music and technology. If you're interested in pushing the boundaries of what's possible in this space, I'd love to hear from you.
